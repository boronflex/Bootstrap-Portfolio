                    He came from somewhere back in her long ago
                    The sentimental fool don't see trying hard to recreate
                    What had yet to be created once in her life
                    She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
                    Never coming near what he wanted to say
                    Only to realize
                    It never really was
                    She had a place in his life
                    He never made her think twice
                    As he rises to her apology
                    Anybody else would surely know
                    He's watching her go
                    But what a fool believes he sees
                    No wise man has the power to reason away
                    What seems to be
                    Is always better than nothing
                    And nothing at all keeps sending him
                    Somewhere back in her long ago
                    Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
                    Someday, somewhere, she will return
                    She had a place in his life
                    He never made her think twice
                    As he rises to her apology
                    Anybody else would surely know
                    He's watching her go
                    But what a fool believes he sees
                    No wise man has the power to reason away
                    What seems to be (if love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
                    Is always better than nothing (fool's got the power)
                    There's nothing at all (oh, now)
                    But what a fool believes he sees (i believe she's never gone away)
                    No wise man has the power 
                    To reason away (to reason away)
                    What seems to be (oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
                    Is always better than nothing (better than nothing)
                    And nothing at all

                    You ain't crazy
                    I ain't gonna lie anymore
                    What you're feelin'
                    There's a reason for
                    I wanna do right
                    Oh, I gotta do right
                    Do I love you
                    Oh, you know I've tried
                    But what you're after
                    You can't find in my eyes
                    I wanna do right
                    Hmm, hmm, hmm, horns

                    Darlin'
                    Tell the truth
                    Don't turn away
                    This is our last chance
                    To touch each others heart
                    Does anything last forever
                    I don't know
                    Maybe we're near the end
                    (So come and tell me)
                    So darlin'
                    Oh, how can we go on together
                    Now that we've grown apart
                    Well the only way to start
                    Is heart to heart

                    One by one
                    We're collecting lies
                    When you can't give love
                    You give alibis
                    Now I'm gonna do right
                    This time I gotta do right
                    I don't wanna leave
                    I don't wanna say good-bye
                    Sooner or later
                    Honey, there comes a time
                    Tomorrow, when you gotta do right
                    Come on home

                    Darlin'
                    Tell the truth
                    Don't turn away
                    From this one last chance
                    To touch each others heart

                    (People say that love will grow)
                    So how was I to know
                    Love that's come through years and years
                    Can't find a way back home
                    Anymore
